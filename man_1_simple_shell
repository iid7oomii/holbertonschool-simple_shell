.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a minimal UNIX command interpreter (holbertonschool-simple_shell project)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ script-file ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsimple_shell\fR is a lightweight command-line interpreter written as part of the Holberton School curriculum. It provides basic shell functionality, including:

.IP \(bu 3
Interactive and non-interactive modes.
.IP \(bu 3
Command parsing and tokenization (handled in \fIparser.c\fR).
.IP \(bu 3
Execution of external commands located via the \fBPATH\fR environment variable (see \fIpath.c\fR).
.IP \(bu 3
Built-in commands like \fBexit\fR and \fBenv\fR (implemented in \fIbuiltins.c\fR).
.IP \(bu 3
Signal handling for Ctrl-C in interactive mode (in \fIsignals.c\fR).

The codebase includes header \fIshell.h\fR for shared declarations and utilities in \fIutils.c\fR.

.SH OPERATION MODES
.SS Interactive Mode
When run interactively, the shell displays a prompt (e.g., \fBhsh>\fR), reads commands, and executes them.

Example:
.EX
$ ./hsh
hsh> ls -l
hsh> env
hsh> exit
.EE

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When commands are piped or redirected:
.EX
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
$ ./hsh < script.sh
.EE

.SH BUILTINS
Implemented built-in commands include:

.TP
\fBexit [status]\fR
Exit the shell with an optional status code.
.TP
\fBenv\fR
Print the environment variables.

.SH EXECUTION
For external commands:
.IP \(bu 3
The shell tokenizes input (in \fIparser.c\fR).
.IP \(bu 3
If it's a builtin, it runs directly (from \fIbuiltins.c\fR).
.IP \(bu 3
Otherwise, it searches \fBPATH\fR (via \fIpath.c\fR) and uses \fIfork\fR/\fIexecve\fR (in \fIexec.c\fR) to run the command.

.SH ERRORS & EXIT STATUS
Common exit codes:
.TP
127 — command not found.
.TP
126 — command found but not executable.
.TP
Other codes — returned from executed commands.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Inherits environment variables such as \fBPATH\fR and passes them to child processes.

.SH FILES
Source files in this repository include:
.TP
\fImain.c\fR, \fIparser.c\fR, \fIexec.c\fR, \fIpath.c\fR, \fbuiltins.c\fR, \fIutils.c\fR, \fIsignals.c\fR, \fshell.h\fR.

.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive:
.EX
$ ./hsh
hsh> echo Hello
Hello
hsh> exit
.EE

Non-interactive:
.EX
$ printf "pwd\nls\nexit\n" | ./hsh
.EE

.SH LIMITATIONS
This shell does not support pipes, redirections, or advanced shell features. It is intended as a learning project and focuses on the basics of shell behavior.
